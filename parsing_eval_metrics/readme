### Help to run the evaluation script ###
Author: Shafiq Joty [sjoty@qf.org.qa]

- Extract Set.tar.gz. 

- Run the perl script:

	Perl ParsingAccuracyMeasuresDocLevelForSystems.pl path_to_sys_dir path_to_gold_dir res.out



The main perl script takes three arguments: 

1.  Path to the directory with the system annotations: 
    The filenames should end with *. doc_dis, but you can change the code according to your need. Here is where you need to change:
    my @canFiles = grep /\w+\.doc_dis/, readdir(DIR);

2. Path to the Directory with the gold annotations:
   It assumes that the file names are the same as the system outputs (e.g., *.doc_dis).

3. The name of the output file:
   In the output file, it shows the results for the individual documents as well as the summary. 

   A sample output file is attached.

The parsed documents should have the same format as RST-DT.
